# AR Object interaction


## An AR app that allows the user to interact with a virtual object Augmented in the real environment

The aim of this hack-a-thing was to learn how to create interactions with an AR android app so that you are able to spawn 3D objects and interact with them using the phone's UI to position, scale and rotate the objects spawned.

## Team

This was a solo project and I did all the work on my own.

## What you learned

The app has a bug that makes it crash upon launch on a mobile phone. Even though I learnt the general process of exporting a unity AR app to an android phone. I am still trying to debug why the app crashes. 
Learnt: ARCore,
